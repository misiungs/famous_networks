This repository is about implementation of various famous networks architectures. Each notebook filename consists of two parts a network name and name of data set that it is used to preliminary train on.  
List of currently implemented networks:  
1. LeNet on 'MNIST' data set - low-level implementation  
2. AlexNet on 'Human or Horses' data set - keras implementation  
3. VGG16 on 'Flowers' data set - keras implementation  
4. GoogLeNet on 'Flowers' data set - keras high-level (inheritance of Model class) implementation  
5. ResNet34 on 'ImageNette' data set - keras high-level (inheritance of Model class) implementation
